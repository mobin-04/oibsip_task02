      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        J. Robert Oppenheimer, born on April 22, 1904, was an American
        theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of
        California, Berkeley. He is best known for his role as the scientific
        director of the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to develop
        the first nuclear weapons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oppenheimer's leadership and contributions to the project were
        instrumental in the successful development of the atomic bomb. His work
        earned him the nickname "Father of the Atomic Bomb."
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        After World War II, Oppenheimer became an advocate for international
        control of atomic energy. He played a key role in the establishment of
        the United States Atomic Energy Commission and contributed to the
        development of the Atoms for Peace program.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite his contributions to science and his efforts to promote peaceful
        uses of atomic energy, Oppenheimer faced scrutiny during the Cold War
        due to his past associations and political beliefs. He was subjected to
        security hearings and had his security clearance revoked, which deeply
        affected his career and reputation.
